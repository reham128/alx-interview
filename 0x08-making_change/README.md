# Coin Change Problem - Dynamic Programming Approach

## Description

This project tackles a classic problem in computer science: finding the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount using a set of coin denominations. This problem tests the application of dynamic programming to solve optimization problems.

## Concepts Covered

- **Dynamic Programming**: Used to find the optimal solution by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Explored as an alternative approach, but not suitable for all cases.
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Focus on minimizing time and space complexity to handle large inputs efficiently.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3
- PEP 8 style compliance
- All files must be executable
